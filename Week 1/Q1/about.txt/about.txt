    <h1>Welcome to My Portifolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Rehan Mullani. A 2nd Year Student in Electrical Engineering At IIT Bombay.</p>
    <pre>I’m a passionate Web Developer and Designer dedicated to crafting responsive, user-friendly, and visually engaging websites.
With a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for design, I specialize in building intuitive digital
experiences that not only look great but also perform seamlessly across all devices.


My skill set includes HTML. I love transforming ideas into clean, efficient code and bringing design concepts to life in the browser. 
Whether it’s a landing page, portfolio, or full-fledged web application, I aim to deliver solutions that combine aesthetic
appeal with functionality.


I’m always learning, adapting, and exploring the latest web trends to ensure that my work remains innovative and up-to-date.</pre>
